        <h2>British Museum</h2>
        <p>
          The British Museum is one of the world's oldest public museums, established in 1753.
          It houses a vast collection of art and antiquities from around the globe, including the Rosetta Stone and Egyptian mummies.
          Located in the Bloomsbury area of London, its architecture features a neoclassical façade with grand columns and a modern glass roof over the Great Court.
          The building incorporates earthy tones like Norway green and Wood Bark brown, which reflect its classical roots.
          The museum is not just a historical archive but a vibrant symbol of cultural exploration.
